Spyder is a powerful scientific computing environment for Python programming language. However, to invode Spyder on macOS, you would need to type: 

```shell
spyder3
```

This would be a little inconvinent and it leaves a terminal open. I will present a new way to create a Mac application bundle for Spyder which can be easily docked and invoked.

1. First, find out the location of your Spyder executable by running:

```shell
which spyder3
```

2. Create a Mac application bundle:

```shell
cd /Applications
mkdir -p spyder.app/Contents/MacOS
echo -e '#!/bin/bash'"\n your_spyder_executable_location $@" >> spyder.app/Contents/MacOS/spyder
chmod +x spyder.app/Contents/MacOS/spyder
```

3. Create a file named Info.plist in the Contents folder (at spyder.app/Contents/Info.plist) with the following content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist SYSTEM "file://localhost/System/Library/DTDs/PropertyList.dtd">
<plist version="0.9">
<dict>
<key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
<string>spyder</string>
<key>CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion</key>
<string>3.1.4</string>
<key>CFBundlePackageType</key>
<string>APPL</string>
<key>CFBundleSignature</key>
<string>????</string>
<key>CFBundleVersion</key>
<string>3.1.4</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

4. Download the Spyder logo [here](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/tree/master/img_src). Click on the Spyder app in Application folder, and press command+i. This will bring up the info. Open the icon image and press control+c, and then copy it to the logo by clicking the icon on top left coner and press control+v.
