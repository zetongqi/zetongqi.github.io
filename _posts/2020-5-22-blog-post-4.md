Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space(RKHS) is related to kernel trick in machine learning and plays a significant role in representation learning. In this post, I will summarize the mathematical definition of RKHS.

First, we define the notion of a metric space. a metric space is defined as following:

Let $S$ be a set, and suppose $d$ is a function defined for all pairs $(x, y)$ of elements from $S$ satisfying:
