Support vector machines in my opinion the best machine learning algorithm. It generalizes well with less risk to overfitting, it scales well to high-dimensional data, and kernel trick makes it possible to efficiently lift the feature space to higher dimensions, and the optimization problem for SVMs are usually quadratic programs that are efficient to solve and has a global minimum. However, there are a few drawbacks to SVMs. The biggest one is that it doesn't scale well with large dataset and the inference time depends on the size of the training dataset. For a training set $ \{ x_i, y_i \}_{i=1}^m$, where $x \in \mathcal{R}^d$, the time complexity to compute the gram matrix is $\mathcal{O}\{ m^2 d\}$ and the time complexity to compute $\{ \}$
